# PROJECT 3 MERN APP: HAPPY CLOUD

## Description

Studies show, actively considering what you are grateful for and writing it down leads to a more fullfilling and happy life. We created a space for you to track your daily gratitude where you can easily reflect on past gratefulness.
After signing up/loging in, the user is able to enter a word every day, which will populate their calendar on the profile page.
The user is then able to click on the "generate cloud button" to get their personalized cloud, that they can also download as a PDF file to share it easily on social media platforms or print it!
